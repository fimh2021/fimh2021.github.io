title: "Meet the experts"
---
The 2021 FIMH Trainee Committee is excited to invite all interested fellow trainees to join us for our “Meet the Expert” sessions.

In these sessions, we aim to provide an informal setting where trainees can interact with more experienced scientists within the field (see below).
The goal is to create a relaxed environment where career advice, approaches to research, creative solutions to work-life balance, ... will be discussed.
We like to motivate all participating trainees to come up with interesting questions to discuss with our experts.

We organize two sessions to accommodate different time zones. 

**Interested trainees can sign up during registration.**
