FIMH-2021 will host two pre-conference workshops on June 21, 2021, [SimVascular](http://www.simvascular.org) and [Cardiac Atlas Project](https://www.cardiacatlas.org), and one post-conference workshops on June 25, 2021 [UncertainSCI](https://www.sci.utah.edu/uqworkshop-2021.html). Note, the main conference will start in June 22, 2021. More information about the workshops is forthcoming.

**[SimVascular](http://www.simvascular.org) Workshop and New User Training (June 21)**

Organizers:       
* Alison Marsden, Stanford University
* David Parker, Stanford University
* Shawn Shadden, UC Berkeley
* Nathan Wilson, Open Source Medical Software Corporation

[SimVascular](http://www.simvascular.org) is the only fully open source software package providing a complete pipeline from medical image data to cardiovascular blood flow simulation results and analysis (www.simvascular.org).  It offers capabilities for image segmentation, unstructured adaptive meshing, physiologic boundary conditions, and two Navier-Stokes finite element solvers with fluid structure interaction capabilities, including large deformation motion with an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation.  An accompanying vascular model repository provides over 100 clinical data sets with simulation results from different parts of the vasculature to enable research.  

Extensive online documentation and tutorials with clinical examples are provided online. 
In this workshop, we will interactively take new users through a step-by-step tutorial, covering the basic steps of model construction, meshing, flow simulations, and best practices for high quality results. We will also introduce several new features of SimVascular, including a module for image segmentation with machine learning, a python scripting interface, and a pipeline for reduced-order modeling with a 1D solver.  Following a series of interactive demonstrations, we will moderate a question and answer session for current and potential users.

**[Cardiac Atlas Project](https://www.cardiacatlas.org) Workshop on Congenital Heart Disease (June 21)**

Organizers:       
* Alistair Young, King's College London
* Andrew McCulloch, UCSD

The Cardiac Atlas Project is a large-scale database of cardiac imaging exams, segmentations, annotations, and associated clinical data. CAP aims to develop a shareable and web-accessible atlas of normal and pathological heart structure and function. One goal of CAP is to facilitate collaborative statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion and characterize cardiac function among and within population groups.

The CAP workshop will focus on congenital heart disease (CHD). Patients with congenital heart disease often require serial imaging examinations to monitor progression and determine the optimal time for interventions. While current global metrics of cardiac size and function, such as indexed ventricular mass and volumes, can identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes, they are not adequate to explain the underlying mechanisms causing them. Recently, data sharing initiatives enable collation of larger numbers of cases in order to enable morphometric informatics approaches.

**[UncertainSCI](https://www.sci.utah.edu/uqworkshop-2021.html) Uncertainty Quantification Workshop (June 25)**

Organizers:       
* Rob MacLeod, University of Utah
* Akil Narayan, University of Utah
* Jess Tate, University of Utah
* Sumientra Rampersad, Northeastern University

<img src="/assets/images/uncertainSCI.png" width="400px" />

[UncertainSCI](https://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc-software/uncertainsci.html) is a Python-based toolkit that harnesses modern techniques to estimate model and parametric uncertainty, with a particular emphasis on needs for biomedical simulations and applications. This toolkit enables non-intrusive integration of these techniques with well-established biomedical simulation software.
