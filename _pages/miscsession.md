title: "Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) "
---

**June 24 - 06:45 am to 08:15 am PDT**


**Organizers:**       
* Radomir Chabiniok, UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas
* Tarique Hussain, UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C, PIMS-TS), is a rare but serious condition associated with the coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 appearing in children typically of the age 4-18 years. It is caused by a delayed aberrant reaction of the immune system to the coronavirus. It affects various organs and organ systems, of which the cardiovascular system is the most common (80% of patients). 80% of MIS-C patients end at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization (cardiovascular shock and heart failure). 
 
In this special theme session, clinicians and non-clinical speakers will introduce the disease, present some cardiac modeling techniques which could contribute during the acute stage at ICU, and show imaging and advanced image analysis tools used to monitor the long-term consequences post MIS-C. The aim is to create an environment for a dialogue with multi-disciplinary contributions. Ample time will be devoted to discussion. 

**Invited speakers:** 
* Kavita Sharma MD, Children’s Medical Center, UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, TX:  The Clinical Complexity of Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19
* Francois Kimmig PhD, Inria & Ecole Polytechnique, France: Towards augmented monitoring of cardiovascular physiology through biophysical modelling and data assimilation 
* Sandy Engelhardt PhD, University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany: MIS-C  — Can AI play a role? 
* Vasu D. Gooty MD, Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN: Cardiac imaging in acute MIS-C – echo based AI in the detection and early to mid-term follow up
